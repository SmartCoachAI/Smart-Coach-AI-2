**SmartCoach AI** is a B2B SaaS solution that empowers gyms to deliver **personalized training at scale** through artificial intelligence.  
The platform adapts workouts, nutrition, and recovery plans automatically based on each member’s progress, feedback, and wearable data.

## 🌟 Overview

Traditional gyms often struggle to provide individual attention to every member due to limited trainers and high member-to-trainer ratios.  
SmartCoach AI solves this problem by offering an AI-powered digital coach that creates **customized, dynamic workout routines** for every user — without requiring additional staff.

The system integrates seamlessly with a gym’s member database and offers real-time analytics for trainers and managers to improve retention and engagement.
